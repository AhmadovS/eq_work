PO2 and PO1 have the same geolocations, so it is reduntat to keep both
PO1 and PO3 has negative scores, means most of the requests are closer to POI location and requests are less scattered
PO4 has positive score, it means the requests are skewed and further than mean
magnitude of PO1 score is greater than PO3 score, so we can deduce that PO3 requests are closer to its location
